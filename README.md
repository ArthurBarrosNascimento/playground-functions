# Project PlayGround Functions ðŸ›¹

<p>This project is important to me because it was when I had my first encounter with the programming language JavaScript. It required the construction of several functions with varying levels of difficulty. Working on this project was a great experience because it challenged me and showed me how fun it is to write code scripts.</p>

<p>The project was carried out during the FullStack Programming course at Trybe, using knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
